# Project 3

## Agreement 

This Project is meant to be an assessment of your ability to present the work from Project 1 and/or 2 in a poster-presentation format.    

In this project, you have the option to work individually or with another student in a group *if* your Project 2 was also with another student. If students work together, they will receive separate scores for Project 3.

You may use any resource, either online or physical, to complete the work. This includes:

 - Any help forum or website (e.g. StackOverflow) questions that already exist.
 - Any notes, code, slides, papers, or previous feedback from the instructor.
 - Any books, online or physical.
 - Scholarly works such as papers.
 - Help from generative artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT.

It DOES NOT include:

 - Help from homework websites such as Course Hero or Chegg.
 - Help from students or persons outside of those currently enrolled in the current semester of CPSC 292. 

If you use work outside normal course resources (textbooks, lecture notes, slides, code, or instructor feedback), you are expected to cite the work by providing a URL to the source near the place that the code was used. If generative AI is used, the use must conform to the authorized use discussed in the course syllabus and you must disclose use on the report. __Failure to disclose AI use or use that is inconsistent with the guidelines on the syllabus will constitute unauthorized AI use and is subject to sanction as an academic integrity violation.__

## Instructions

  - __Step 1:__ You will work with your visualizations from Project 1 or 2. Add a line of code that saves your visualization(s) in a `results/` folder as a PDF. There is nothing to turn in for this step. Create a poster according to the instructions below that describe and interpret the visualizations you've created in context. Optional: submit to your instructor for feedback via slack 48 hours before the assigned due date for your section.
  - __Step 2:__ Turn in the final version of your poster to Canvas under Project 3 for printing by the following deadlines: 
    - Section 1: __Friday, December 5, 2025 by 4 pm__
    - Section 2: __Monday, December 1, 2025 by 4 pm__
    
    __If you miss the deadline for your section, you are responsible for printing and bringing your own poster to the final exam.__
  - __Step 3:__ Attend the final exam and present your poster with a short (2--3 minute) oral presentation. 
    - Section 1 Final exam: __Friday, December 12, 2025 1:30 -- 4 pm__
    - Section 2 Final exam: __Monday, December 8, 2025 10:45 am -- 1:15 pm__


## Additional Information

The poster should have the following elements: 

  - A __Title__ for the work that clearly describes the purpose of the project.
  - The names of __authors__ and their __affiliations__ (i.e, what university they are a part of).
  - A __Background__ section that explains the necessary information needed to understand the poster and clearly stated question(s) that drives the visualizations.
  - An __Analysis__ section that provides a reference to the data set and an abbreviated description of any analysis done for the visualizations.
  - A __Results__ section that provides the visualizations with captions and any other results.
  - A __Conclusions__ section that provides a list of conclusions derived from the visualizations that answer the question(s) in the Background.
  - An __Acknowledgements__ section that thanks anyone who has helped you with the work that's not an author. 
  - A __References__ sections that provides full references for anything referenced in the poster. Include an AI use disclosure here, if applicable.

Furthermore, the poster must satisfy the following requirements: 

  - Your poster should be no larger than 36 inches by 30 inches and no smaller than 24 inches by 20 inches and printed on a single sheet of paper.
  - __ALL text__ on the poster should be at least 8 pt, or readable at arm's distance away when printed full size.
  - Must reference the original data set with a full reference including a URL. 
  - Must credit the source of any images not directly created by an author. 
  - Must disclose the use of generative AI if used on the poster or the project it is based upon.
  
## How Project 3 will be graded 

As with all work in the course, Project 3 will be assessed for completeness, in other words, you will receive a complete (2 awarded course points) or incomplete (0 awarded course points). Completion will be scored on: 

  - Presence and completeness of each of the poster items and requirements outlined above.
  - Satisfactory presentation of the poster at the final exam during the scheduled time.
