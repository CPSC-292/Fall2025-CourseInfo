## Assignment 2.5: ggplot Geometric Object Types

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Loading required libraries
# Do not alter this section of code!
library(viridis)
```

Be sure to write any regular text in the white space (not the gray code blocks).

### Collaboration team: 

Record who you've worked on the assignment with here. 

### Assignment

You will work in a group with several other students, please sign up on `Canvas > People > Assignment 2.5 - Student plots`.

Prepare some sample code for using each of the following groups of geometric objects for your classmates: 

 1. Continuous x, y data: `geom_point()`, `geom_line()`, `geom_qq_line()`; \
 example data sets (package): `DNase (datasets)`, `Loblolly (datasets)`, `diamonds (ggplot2)`, `urine (boot)`
 2. Continuous y, categorical x data: `geom_bar()`, `geom_boxplot()`, `geom_violin()`; \
 example data sets (package): `InsectSprays (datasets)`, `wool (boot)`, `diamonds (ggplot2)`, `starwars (dplyr)`
 3. Data from distributions:  `geom_histogram()`, `geom_density()`, `geom_dotplot()`; \
 example data sets (package): `diamonds (ggplot2)`, `txhousing (ggplot2)`, `singer (lattice)`
 4. Data on maps: `geom_map()`, `geom_polygon()`; \
 example data sets: `seals (ggplot2)`, `lakers (lubridate)`
 5. Data in matrices (2D data): `geom_raster()`, `geom_tile()`, `geom_contour()` \
 example data sets: `volcano (datasets)`, `diamonds (ggplot2)` 
 6. Choose your own adventure. Choose a package from the [ggplot extension gallery](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/).
 
Be ready to give a short presentation on each graph type in the next class period. Let us know the following things: 

 * what does the plot look like (present an example of each)
 * explain what data are appropriate for use (categorical, continuous, etc)
 * what does the plot tell us about the data (generally)
 
Before class, you'll be responsible for turning in an R Markdown file with the example code as part of this assignment. During class, you will present the R Markdown file and code to the class.
